Examples of poorly designed inheritance:

1. Inheritance is used to share behaviour without specializing.
2. A method in the superclass is overwritten with a different behaviour by a subclass.
3. A subclass inherits methods from the superclass and adds extra, new, unrelated functionality.

Example of good Inheritance:

The subclasses inherit methods from the superclass and have their own specific, related methods.
(Means, share behaviour with specialization)
